## Description 

This is a tutorial project created by me to support a lecture I gave to final year computer games programming students (De Montfort University) on how to import and animate a skeletal mesh in C++, and use OpenGL and GLSL for rendering. The model vertices and animation keyframe data were imported using the Assimp library. 

The main files of interest are *[https://github.com/dinismf/skeletal_animation_tutorial/blob/master/TeapotAD/SkeletalModel.h] 


Developed in Visual Studio 2015.
